# Data science in Fast food

In this post we have dataset of fastfood item.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library("tidymodels")
data<-read.csv("fastfood.csv")
data
```

Lets first check the resuturant and check the distrubution

```{r}
resturant <- table(data$restaurant)
pie(resturant)
```


lets check the distrubution of the total cals of each food item.

```{r}
hist(data$calories)
```

As we can see most of food item has calories around 500.

```{r}
cholesterol_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(cholesterol ~ cal_fat + total_fat + trans_fat, data = data)
tidy(cholesterol_fit)
```
